# Advanced Investment Calculator
A comprehensive investment calculator offering SIP, Lumpsum, SWP (Systematic Withdrawal Plan), and inflation-adjusted calculations for optimized financial planning. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this application enables users to make better-informed investment decisions by providing extensive customization and detailed projections.

# Features
- SIP Calculator: Calculates maturity values for systematic investment plans, allowing users to account for step-up contributions, inflation rates, and personalized interest rates.
- Lumpsum Calculator: Computes the future value of one-time investments, adjusting for inflation and interest growth.
- SWP Calculator: Helps plan systematic withdrawals from investments with options for adjustable step-up withdrawal rates and year-by-year breakdowns.
- Inflation Calculator: Estimates future or present values based on inflation rates, giving users a clear picture of long-term purchasing power.
- Customizable Themes: Users can personalize the look of the calculator with a variety of themes for a better visual experience.
- Interactive Tabs and Dynamic Dropdowns: Organized layout with smooth tab transitions and dropdowns that display contextually, ensuring a user-friendly interface.
- Investment History Tracking: Saves past calculations for easy comparison and financial record-keeping.
- Why This Calculator Stands Out:
    While existing investment calculators on platforms like Groww, Zerodha, and Angel One offer standard SIP and Lumpsum options, they often lack the flexibility to adjust for variables such as:

- Inflation Adjustment: Provides a more accurate future or present value, helping investors understand real returns after inflation.
- SWP with Step-Up Withdrawal Rates: Allows retirees or long-term investors to plan a steady withdrawal rate that adapts over time, essential for     better retirement planning.
- Detailed Yearly Breakdowns: Offers transparency and year-by-year investment growth, enabling users to track how their money grows over time.
- User-Centric Features: The intuitive design and theming options give users full control over the interface, enhancing the overall experience.
- Advantages Over Other Calculators
  This project was designed with personalization, advanced financial forecasting, and user-friendliness in mind, offering distinct advantages over other investment tools:

- Greater Flexibility in Calculations: Users can customize inflation rates, step-up contributions, and withdrawal amounts, resulting in more accurate and tailored results.
- In-Depth Financial Insights: Each calculation type provides not only future values but also inflation-adjusted values, total growth, and year-by-year breakdowns.
- All-in-One Tool: Combines SIP, Lumpsum, SWP, and Inflation calculators in one application, eliminating the need to rely on multiple tools for a complete financial overview.
- Built-in History Tracking: Saves previous calculations for easy reference, allowing users to monitor and compare their investments over time.
